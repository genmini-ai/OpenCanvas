My AI PPT has one issue that is layout, when the LLM is generating the html code for presentation (fixed shape) for some pages the content will overflow, overlap or be outsized. Any potential solution? Because when I see adamcad, it can essentially takes a text prompt in and a 3d model out, the 2d layout optimization should be way easier compared to 3d right?
ChatGPT said:
To help you better with your layout issue, could you please share a bit more detail on the following:

What specific HTML structure or framework are you using for your AI-generated presentation (e.g., Reveal.js, bespoke HTML/CSS, deck.js)?

Is the layout intended to be responsive across different screen sizes or fixed-size?

Are you looking for an automatic solution that dynamically adjusts layout (e.g., font size, spacing, container resizing) or one that ensures content fits within fixed boundaries?

Do you have a sample of the generated HTML or a specific example slide where the layout breaks?

This will help me tailor suggestions or research more advanced layout optimization solutions for your use case.

Prevent Overflow and Layout Issues in Fixed-Size HTML Slides

Solving Layout Overflow in AI-Generated Slides
Understanding the Overflow/Overlap Issue
When using an LLM to generate HTML/CSS slides at a fixed size, it often produces more content or larger elements than the slide can accommodate. This leads to overflow (content spilling outside the slide) or overlap (elements covering each other) – classic signs that the slide’s layout is not handling the content volume. In fact, researchers have noted that weaker LLM-based slide generators often suffer from elements overlapping or exceeding the canvas, making it hard to read all information clearly
arxiv.org
. By default, if a container is too small, overflow happens when there is too much content to fit in a box
developer.mozilla.org
. CSS will render overflowing content visibly (to avoid “data loss”) unless told otherwise
developer.mozilla.org
, which is why you might see text or images spilling out of the slide’s boundaries. The root cause is that the LLM isn’t inherently aware of the slide’s fixed dimensions during generation – it might generate lengthy bullet lists, large fonts, or big images without “knowing” they won’t fit. This results in content that either requires scrolling, gets cut off, or overlaps other slide elements, hurting the presentation’s visual clarity.
2D Layout vs. 3D Generation Complexity
Your intuition is correct: optimizing a 2D slide layout is generally much simpler than generating a 3D model from text. Tools like AdamCAD demonstrate that modern AI can take a text prompt and produce a corresponding 3D CAD model
adam.new
. Laying out content on a 2D slide is a more constrained problem – it’s about positioning and sizing existing elements (text boxes, images, shapes) within a rectangle, rather than inventing geometry. In principle, this should be easier because we’re just dealing with 2D coordinates and sizes, not complex volumetric shapes. There’s a long history of algorithms for UI and document layout which we can leverage. For example, constraint-based layout systems and heuristics exist to arrange GUI elements without overlap. So yes, compared to the leap of generating novel 3D objects, 2D layout optimization is a well-known problem and easier to tackle with either straightforward rules or lightweight AI. That said, “easier” doesn’t mean “trivial” – a slide layout must still obey design best practices (e.g. no element overlaps, all content readable, balanced use of space
arxiv.org
). But overall, you have many more deterministic tools at your disposal for 2D layouts.
Using HTML/CSS Best Practices to Prevent Overflow
One immediate solution is to refine the HTML/CSS so that it gracefully handles extra content. Here are some best practices:
Constrain Images and Diagrams: Ensure that images or embedded graphics (like Mermaid diagrams) scale down to fit the slide. You can set a max-width (and max-height) of 100% on such elements, so they never exceed their container. For example, a CSS snippet from an Obsidian user shows preventing Mermaid charts from spilling off a page by forcing the SVG to max-width: 100% and max-height: 100%
forum.obsidian.md
. This way, large diagrams shrink to fit within the slide box instead of overflowing.
Enable Scrolling or Hiding (if absolutely necessary): If content is only slightly too large, making the slide <div> scrollable can at least prevent overlap. In your provided code, .slide already uses overflow-y: auto;, which adds a scrollbar when content exceeds the fixed height. This preserves all content, though scrolling within a presentation slide is not ideal UX. Alternatively, setting overflow: hidden on the slide container would simply clip anything outside
stackoverflow.com
, but that risks cutting off content entirely, so use with caution. Generally, it’s better to avoid overflow in the first place than to hide it after the fact.
Flexible Layouts vs Fixed Positions: Favor using CSS Flexbox or Grid to let content flow naturally, instead of absolute positioning that can easily overlap items if their sizes change. Your slide code already employs flex containers (e.g. the .two-column flex layout on Slide 3) to distribute content. Ensure that all text boxes and images are in normal flow or flex/grid containers so that they push each other rather than sitting on top of each other. This will eliminate most overlap issues – elements will move or wrap when there's extra content instead of painting over one another. You might also allow flex items to wrap or the layout to become vertical on overflow. For instance, a media query in your CSS already switches the two-column layout to a single column on narrow screens; similarly, you could allow a two-column layout to wrap on itself if content grows too tall.
Responsive Scaling with Viewport Units: Since the slides have a fixed landscape aspect ratio, you can experiment with sizing text in vw or vh (viewport width/height units). This makes font-size relative to the slide size. However, this is a blunt tool – it will shrink everything uniformly and may not respond perfectly to overflow. It’s generally better to dynamically adjust only when needed, which leads to JavaScript solutions.
Automatic Text and Element Scaling
For text-heavy overflow, a classic solution is auto-resizing the text to fit its container. There are several open-source tools that tackle this by measuring text dimensions and adjusting font-size on the fly. For example, libraries like FitText.js, TextFit, or Fitty can automatically scale down font sizes so that the text precisely fills its box without spilling over
dev.to
. Integrating such a library or algorithm into your slide generation can ensure that, say, if a bullet list is one line too long, the font size is reduced just enough to make it fit. The Dev.to tutorial “Make text fit its parent size” discusses this approach and even provides code examples for different scenarios (fixed container vs. auto-sizing container)
dev.to
dev.to
. The gist is to measure the content (e.g. via scrollHeight of a text container) and iteratively shrink the text until it no longer overflows. This can be done with a simple binary search or incremental adjustment in JavaScript. Similarly, for other elements like images or diagrams, you can apply scaling. One strategy is to wrap the entire slide content in a parent <div> and, if overflow is detected (e.g. content height > slide height), apply a CSS transform: scale(0.x) to that parent to uniformly shrink all content to fit. This maintains the layout proportions, just making everything a bit smaller. The downside is if you shrink too much, text can become tiny. So it’s a balancing act – you might set a minimum font size or only allow scaling down say 10-20% at most. Nonetheless, dynamic scaling is a quick fix to avoid overflow without manual intervention.
Splitting or Reorganizing Content Across Slides
Another solution is at the content level: if a slide is overloaded, split the content into multiple slides or sub-sections. This might be preferable to squishing everything onto one slide. For example, if the LLM generates 10 bullet points for a single slide, that’s likely too much for one page. You could implement a post-processing step that says: “if a slide has more than N bullet items or exceeds X characters, break it into two slides.” The first slide could contain the first half and the next slide continues with the rest (perhaps titled “Slide Title (cont’d)” for clarity). This way, each slide stays clean and readable. Splitting content can be done by parsing the HTML output or (better) by structuring the generation. If you have control over the LLM prompt, you could instruct it to limit the amount of content per slide (e.g. “no more than 5 bullet points per slide”). Realize that presentations thrive on brevity – a common guideline is no more than 3-5 points per slide. Encouraging the model to be concise will naturally reduce overflow issues. It looks like your Agenda slide (Slide 2) lists 6 items, which is fine in that design, but if any slide goes much beyond that, it’s a candidate for splitting. Reorganization can also help: for instance, turning a dense list into a two-column layout to use space better. Your Slide 3 already does this by dividing content into two side-by-side cards. If one column’s list was very long, converting it into two columns can halve the vertical space usage. You could programmatically decide to use a multi-column layout if a list has over, say, 8 items. The LLM might not automatically choose that, but you can define templates (one-column vs two-column) and have the generation pick the appropriate template based on content length (either via prompt engineering or a simple rule in your code). By choosing an appropriate layout template for the content, you prevent overflow before it happens.
Template and Constraint-Based Approaches
Rather than letting the LLM freestyle all HTML/CSS, you can guide it with templates that inherently respect layout constraints. For example, define a set of slide layouts (title slide, bullet list slide, image + text slide, etc.) that are known not to overflow if used properly. Each template would specify how many items or how much text it can comfortably hold. Then, either prompt the LLM to fill these templates or use a simple programmatic step to slot the generated content into the right template. This way, the structure is predictable and less likely to break. It’s the same idea behind Microsoft PowerPoint Designer or Beautiful.ai – they use pre-defined design layouts and simply flow your content into them. PowerPoint’s Designer, for instance, analyzes your content and suggests a few layout options that fit it nicely
slidegenius.com
. Similarly, Wondershare’s AI Presentation tool claims to “automatically adjust the layout, formatting, and styling to fit any content” by using a library of 20+ smart layout styles
presentory.wondershare.com
. While the implementation details are proprietary, likely it’s picking a suitable template (e.g., if you add a large image and some text, it chooses a layout with the image beside the text instead of on a tiny half of the slide). You can mimic this approach: determine content structure (how many points, any images, any graphs?) and then choose an appropriate layout pattern that you know can accommodate it. This avoids scenarios like the LLM unintentionally putting a giant image on a slide with no scaling – your template would have img { max-width:100% } or a designated image placeholder style. Another more algorithmic angle is to apply constraint-based layout adjustment. UI frameworks (like Apple’s Auto Layout or web CSS itself) use constraint solvers to satisfy layout requirements (no overlap, margins between elements, etc.). You could encode rules like “all elements must fit within 1024x768 (for example) and have at least 20px padding to the edges” and then adjust element sizes until those constraints are met. In practice, this could be as simple as reducing font sizes or image sizes when content overflows, as discussed earlier, but framed as satisfying a constraint “content height <= slide height”. Given that 2D layout is a well-researched domain, there are even academic algorithms for automatic document layout
dl.acm.org
 and GUI layout optimizations that you might draw from if you want to get fancy. However, for most cases, a combination of the simpler methods above (template selection, flexbox, auto-scaling text) will handle it.
AI-Assisted Layout Refinement
Since you already have an AI generating the slides, you can consider using AI for a second-pass layout refinement as well. One idea is to have the LLM itself analyze its output for potential overflow. For example, after the HTML is generated, you could prompt the LLM with something like: “Review the slide HTML and ensure no text is too long or overlapping. If any slide has too much content, split it or shorten the text.” This is somewhat speculative, but modern models (especially GPT-4 level) can reason about lengths of text and might follow an instruction to break content into two slides or truncate verbose sections. In academic experiments, allowing the model to iteratively refine its output has shown improved layout: the AutoPresent system found that letting GPT-4 review and adjust the slide code led to better alignment, sizing, and obeying of instructions
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. Essentially, the model can be prompted to simulate a “render” in its mind and fix obvious issues (e.g., it knows if it put 12 items in a list, that’s too many). This approach isn’t guaranteed, but it can catch things that slip through the initial generation. Outside of LLMs, one could also use a bit of computer-vision or DOM math to detect overflow after rendering. For instance, render the slide in a headless browser and check element positions/sizes – if anything exceeds the slide dimensions or overlaps (there are libraries that can detect overlapping elements by their bounding boxes), then trigger an adjustment. That adjustment could be automated (as we discussed: shrink text, split slide, etc.) or even fed back to an AI to regenerate that slide with instructions to be more concise. Finally, it’s worth noting that the bar for solving 2D layout is much lower than what tools like AdamCAD do for 3D. In 3D model generation, the AI has to invent geometry that doesn’t collide or look wrong – a very high-dimensional problem. In 2D, we’re mostly dealing with box sizes and text lengths, which are easier to manage with deterministic algorithms. The existence of many AI presentation makers and auto-design tools shows that this is feasible: for example, Beautiful.ai’s DesignerBot and others focus on arranging your content nicely on slides using AI heuristics or rules
beautiful.ai
presentory.wondershare.com
. These systems might use machine learning to choose a layout, but once chosen, enforcing that everything fits is a straightforward programming task.
Conclusion
Potential solutions to your layout issue include a mix of smarter CSS and intelligent post-processing. Start with CSS rules to prevent obvious overflow (flexible containers, max-width on images/graphs, perhaps smaller default font sizes or line-heights). Then consider dynamic approaches: auto-shrinking text when needed, or splitting content across slides when it’s too much. Template-driven generation can give the LLM a framework that inherently avoids overstuffing a slide. And if you’re adventurous, leverage AI for a refinement pass to tweak the layout. Given that AI can already go from text to complex 3D models in tools like AdamCAD, tackling a 2D slide layout is absolutely within reach – it’s largely a solved problem of fitting boxes in a rectangle, with many available techniques to ensure nothing overflows or overlaps on your slides
