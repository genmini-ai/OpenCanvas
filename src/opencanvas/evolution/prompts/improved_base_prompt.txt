<presentation_task>
Create a visually stunning and FACTUALLY ACCURATE HTML presentation based on this content:

{blog_content}

Purpose of presentation: {purpose}
Visual theme: {theme}
</presentation_task>

<critical_accuracy_requirements>
MANDATORY CONTENT FIDELITY RULES - THESE OVERRIDE ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS:
1. NEVER add numerical data, statistics, or percentages not explicitly stated in the source
2. If source says "improved" or "increased" without numbers, DO NOT invent percentages
3. Include ALL major sections from the source, even if condensing details
4. Preserve the exact hierarchy and structure of information from source
5. Include all steps of multi-step processes (never skip intermediate steps)
6. Cover ALL ethical considerations mentioned in the source
7. Do not reorganize content in ways that change its meaning or context
8. If creating visual representations of data, only use data explicitly provided
9. Preserve technical details and methodological context from source
10. When source lists examples, maintain them as examples (not main categories)
</critical_accuracy_requirements>

<design_philosophy>
CREATE VISUAL EXCELLENCE WITH ACCURACY:
- Prioritize the "wow factor" through sophisticated visual storytelling
- Make every slide feel alive with purposeful animations that enhance content
- Use bold, vibrant colors with strategic contrast for visual hierarchy
- Implement modern design techniques (glassmorphism, neumorphism, subtle 3D)
- Balance visual excitement with professional polish and readability
- Create a premium, cutting-edge experience with cohesive visual language
- Transform abstract concepts into accurate visual metaphors
- Ensure visual enhancements never compromise factual accuracy
</design_philosophy>

<visual_requirements>
1. Create a self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
2. Use consistent slide transitions with ONLY opacity-based methods (opacity: 0 to opacity: 1)
3. Implement a sophisticated color palette with primary/secondary/accent colors for "{theme}"
4. Include purposeful micro-interactions: hover effects, animated reveals, subtle parallax
5. Use no more than 2 complementary font families with varied weights for hierarchy
6. Add depth through 3-5 distinct layers (background, mid-ground, foreground)
7. Design 10-15 slides following a visual grid system (6 or 12 column)
8. Use progressive reveal animations for bullet points (3-5 points per slide maximum)
9. Create an impactful title slide with brand-aligned animations
10. Optimize for 1280px × 720px with responsive scaling
11. Implement frosted glass effects for content containers (backdrop-filter: blur(8px))
12. Use high-contrast color combinations for maximum readability
13. Apply the golden ratio (1:1.618) for proportional element sizing
14. Create visual rhythm through consistent spacing and alignment patterns
15. Use variable opacity levels (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%) for visual hierarchy
16. Add dimensional lighting effects with consistent light source direction
17. Implement cinematic composition techniques (rule of thirds, leading lines)
18. Create custom animated transitions between major sections (max 800ms)
</visual_requirements>

<content_presentation>
ACCURACY-FIRST CONTENT STRUCTURING:
- Transform complex concepts into visual metaphors WITHOUT adding information
- Limit text to 3-5 bullet points per slide from actual source content
- Create clear visual hierarchy through size, weight, color, and positioning
- Structure content following source's narrative arc (don't reorganize)
- Include elegant progress indicators showing presentation context
- Implement scannable headings (4-7 words) using source's terminology
- Create visual anchors for key concepts using source's emphasis
- Use progressive disclosure for complex information from source
- Ensure every claim can be traced back to the source material
- Mark any necessary interpretations clearly as such
</content_presentation>

<content_verification_checklist>
Before finalizing each slide, verify:
□ All numerical data comes directly from source (no invented statistics)
□ All major sections from source are represented
□ Multi-step processes include all steps
□ Examples remain as examples (not elevated to main points)
□ Ethical considerations are fully covered if present in source
□ Technical terminology matches source exactly
□ No claims beyond what source explicitly states
□ Visual representations only use provided data
</content_verification_checklist>

<slide_structure_guidelines>
For different content types FROM SOURCE:
- Statistics/Data: Only visualize numbers explicitly provided in source
- Processes: Include ALL steps mentioned, maintain exact sequence
- Comparisons: Only compare items explicitly compared in source
- Benefits/Challenges: Include all points mentioned, don't add new ones
- Technical concepts: Preserve full technical accuracy and context
- Case studies: Maintain exact details and outcomes as stated
- Future projections: Only include predictions explicitly made in source
- Quotes: Preserve exact wording and attribution
</slide_structure_guidelines>

<technical_implementation>
1. Ensure smooth 60fps animations using CSS transforms and will-change
2. Implement keyboard navigation (arrow keys, spacebar, ESC)
3. Add touch/swipe support for mobile devices
4. Optimize for performance with requestAnimationFrame
5. Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
6. Implement proper z-index layering (10, 20, 30, etc.)
7. Use CSS custom properties for consistent theming
8. Include print styles for PDF export compatibility
9. Test all animations at different screen sizes
10. Implement preloading for smooth transitions
</technical_implementation>

<final_quality_checks>
The presentation MUST:

✓ Include ALL major content sections from source
✓ Maintain source's information hierarchy
✓ Present information accurately without embellishment
✓ Use visual enhancements that support, not distort, content
✓ Function smoothly with all interactions
✓ Be immediately understandable and memorable
