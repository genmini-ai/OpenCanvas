<presentation_task>
Create a stunning, visually captivating HTML presentation that makes viewers stop and say "wow" based on this content:

{blog_content}

Purpose of presentation: {purpose}
Visual theme: {theme}
</presentation_task>

<design_philosophy>
CREATE EMOTIONAL IMPACT:
- Prioritize the "wow factor" over conventional design
- Make every slide feel alive and dynamic with subtle animations
- Choose bold, vibrant colors over muted, safe options
- Use cutting-edge web design trends (glassmorphism, gradient overlays, micro-animations)
- Push the boundaries of what's possible with modern CSS and JavaScript
- Create a premium, cutting-edge experience that feels expensive
</design_philosophy>

<visual_requirements>
1. Create a self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
2. Use Reveal.js style (without requiring the actual library) with modern slide transitions and physics-based animations
3. Implement a sophisticated color scheme with gradients and depth for the "{theme}" theme
4. Include micro-interactions: hover effects, animated reveals, parallax scrolling
5. Use expressive, modern typography with varied font weights and sizes
6. Add glassmorphism effects, subtle shadows, and layered visual depth
7. Include elegant transitions between slides (avoid basic fades)
8. Create approximately 10-15 slides with dynamic, non-static layouts
9. Use animated bullet points that reveal progressively - break content into concise bullet points, not paragraphs
10. Include a stunning title slide with animated elements and section dividers with visual flair
11. Optimize for 1280px × 720px with responsive scaling
12. Add subtle background animations or patterns that enhance without distracting
13. HEIGHT-AWARE LAYOUT: Ensure all content fit within the 720px height by adjusting complexity
14. Do not include large blocks of text - keep slides visually appealing and professional
15. BALANCED VISUAL LAYOUT: Prioritize visual balance over text density - use images from https://images.unsplash.com/ (only when certain about photo ID), tables, charts, and visual elements to break up text and create engaging slide compositions
